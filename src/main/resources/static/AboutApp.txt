Persona 3, localized in the West as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3, is the fourth game in the Persona series. The game was developed by Atlus for the PlayStation 2.

Persona 3 follows a group of high school students trying to find their own reasons for living in a world surrounded by death that they're forced to cope with, understand and accept. They form a group called SEES in order to investigate the Dark Hour, a mysterious time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, SEES explores Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of their inner self.

An enhanced version of the game containing an epilogue called The Answer was released as Persona 3 FES, also for the PlayStation 2. This version is available on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3.

A portable version of the original Persona 3, adding an optional female protagonist and various quality of life changes was released as Persona 3 Portable for PlayStation Portable in 2009. A remaster of Portable was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Microsoft Windows via Steam and the Microsoft Store, in 2023.
